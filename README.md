# OSS Audit

A resource to help people find open source software projects that are beginner-friendly and committed to diversity and inclusion.

## Questions
Here are some initial questions for investigating an open source project. Remember: your time and labor is valuable! Give it to an open source project community that treats its contributors well.

- Where do people communicate? Slack? GitHub? IRC? Mailing list? Forum?
- CONTRIBUTING.MD? Wiki?
- Code of Conduct? How short or extensive?

- Do maintainers / contributors say THANK YOU, is discussion and review respectful and helpful?
- Is code review actionable, specific, and kind? 
- If stuff DOES violate code of conduct, do community members respond and act?
- How many maintainers are there? Who approves changes? Is it mostly one person? A group of people?

- How often do Pull Requests get merged
- How to submit issues?
- What labels are used for issues?
- Git workflow? How to get maintainers attention for PR review?
- documentation?

- Environment setup docs?
- Tests? Do they pass when you run them?
- Continuous integration? Code coverage?
- Style guides?
