## Testing best practices
First of all, make sure you have the correct build environment. TimelineJS uses Python 2.7. Make sure you install all the requirements and set up a virtual requirement. To test your changes, use `fab build` to compile your chagnes for testing and `fab serve` to run a local web server. The URL for you local test environment is [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/ ).
